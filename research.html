        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>The Yuan group's research encompasses four major directions: renewable biomaterials, carbon capture and utilization, 
            integrated biorefining, systems and synthetic biology.</p><br>
        <img src="img/Figure.PNG" alt="Figure 1">
        <p>For renewable biomaterial, we have pioneered new chemical fractionation and manufacturing technologies along with 
            feedstock design to process lignin into quality carbon fibers, bioplastics, recyclable polymer and biodegradable 
            plastics composites, biodiesel, nanoparticle, asphalt binder modifier and other products. The technology breakthroughs 
            are based on fundamental understanding of structure-function relationship between lignin chemistry and renewable 
            material performance. Furthermore, his team have engineered microorganisms to convert lignin and other waste products 
            into structurally preferred PHA for broad bioplastic applications.</p><br>
        <p>For carbon capture and utilization (CCU), we focused on overcoming the fundamental limits of solar-to-molecule 
            efficiency in the natural photosynthesis system to achieve efficient carbon capture, conversion, and utilization. 
            Our research advances two frontiers. First, we advance the chem-bio hybrid route to by-pass Rubisco carbon fixation 
            with electro- or photo-catalysis to produce biocompatible intermediates for downstream bioconversions. Recent 
            breakthroughs in EMC2+ (Electro-Microbial conversion with C2+ intermediates) system have surpassed the solar-to-molecule 
            energy efficiency in natural photosynthesis by multiple folds, achieving very efficient carbon capture and conversion. 
            Second, we have addressed several major challenges in algal carbon capture and utilization. We have integrated artificial 
            intelligence and synthetic biology to develop continuous algal cultivation technologies achieving the highest reported 
            outdoor productivity. Based on this technology, they are advancing novel CCU platforms for flue gas, direct air capture, 
            and various other CO2 emissions. We also developed auto-sedimentation to reduce the harvest cost substantially.</p><br>
        <p>For integrated biorefining, our team addressed the dilemma of "lignin-first" and "carbohydrate-first" processes and 
            designed novel biorefining procedures to synergistically derive more processable lignin and carbohydrate. Together with 
            the biomaterial design and synthetic biology, these engineering technologies could potentially enable the integrated 
            biorefinery with multiple product streams for profitability and sustainability.</p><br>
        <p>For systems and synthetic biology, Professor Yuan's team advanced the fundamental understanding of photosynthetic 
            carbon repartition from sugar metabolism to terpene biosynthesis. The research has led to the sustainable manufacturing 
            platform for squalene, an essential vaccine adjuvant, cosmetic and nutraceutical product. The research also empowered 
            efficient biomass processing and algal biofuels and bioproduct manufacturing.</p>
